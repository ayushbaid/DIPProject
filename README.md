# DIPProject
* The use of residuals in image denoising
* based on Brunet et. al.

# Code Environment Requirements
* This code will run on Windows OS only due to the use of file specific paths in a 3rd party toolbox used.

# Code Licence
The Total Variation Minimization filter code has been used as a black box. The toolbox is located at <code>./toolbox_optim/</code>. This toolbox has Windows OS specific paths and hence will work on windows machine only

# Test Images
The test images are located in <code>./USC_SIPI_DATABASE</code>

# Running instructions
Run the <code>myMainScript.m</code> to run the algo over all the images in the test set for different values of the simulated noise variance.
